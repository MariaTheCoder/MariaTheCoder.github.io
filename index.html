        Hello! My name is Maria and I am from Denmark. At the time of writing
        this post, I work full-time as an accountant assistant in Odder,
        Denmark, with nearly 2.5 years of work experience in my current field.
        <br />
        <br />
        My spare time is often spent on programming in one way or the other.
        Some days I enjoy working on personal projects to which some are
        published on GitHub, listening to programming related podcasts while
        doing chores, watching tutorials on Git, object-oriented programming,
        Node.js and much more.
