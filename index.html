      Hello! My name is Maria and I am from Denmark. At the time of writing this
      post, I work full-time as an accountant assistant in Odder, Denmark, with
      nearly 2.5 years of work experience in my current field.
      <br />
      <br />
      My spare time is often spent on programming in one way or the other. Some
      days I enjoy working on personal projects to which some are published on
      GitHub, listening to programming related podcasts while doing chores,
      watching tutorials on Git, OOP, Node.js and much more.
