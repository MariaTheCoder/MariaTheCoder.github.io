      Hello! My name is Maria and I am from Denmark. At the time of writing this
      post, I work full-time as an accountant assistant in Odder, Denmark, with
      nearly 2.5 years of work experience in my current field.
      <br />
      <br />
      My spare time is often spent on programming in one way or the other. Some
      days I enjoy working on personal projects to which some are published on
      GitHub, listening to programming related podcasts while doing chores,
      watching tutorials on Git, OOP, Node.js and much more.

    <h2>How my journey in web-development began</h2>

      My first encounter with programming happened at the University of Aarhus
      in 2014 when I was enrolled in a mandatory 3 months introduction course in
      object orientated programming. In this course the programming language
      Java was in focus.
      <br />
      <br />
      My first experience with learning how to code is a very fond one. Back
      then I had a lot of fun with learning how to create objects, arrays
      containing objects, how to filter and sort elements inside of an array
      given certain criteria and print out the result etc.
      <br />
      <br />
      It was my very first experience with learning how to code and I found
      myself spending hours upon hours going through tutorials handed out by
      tutors, going through previously used examination papers as well as
      cleaning up my old code.
      <br />
      <br />
      While I definitely enjoyed this course, it wasn't until 2020 that my
      attention was once again switched back to programming. My interest in
      programming was rekindled after I had watched a YouTube video on
      JavaScript shared by my boyfriend.
      <br />
      <br />
      During the video we paused multiple times and repeated the exercises in
      Node.js. My boyfriend, who has a well-established career in IT, went
      through with me step by step, how the JS code worked and helped me
      understand what caused bugs when they occured. I found myself so intrigued
      that I soon signed up for the full JS course done by the very same
      creator. A paid for course worth every penny.
